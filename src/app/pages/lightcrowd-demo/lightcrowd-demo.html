          While exploring this concept, several limitations emerged. The term agoraphobia proved too specific, implying clinical expertise beyond our scope and narrowing our target audience. Many people experience crowd-related anxiety without a formal diagnosis. We therefore refocused on the broader experience of anxiety in crowds. Music events â€” particularly concert pits â€” became our natural context: powerful collective spaces that many know firsthand, yet can quickly turn from excitement to discomfort or distress.
        </p>

        <p class="muted">
          Concert experiences are often perceived as moments of euphoria and sharing. However, for some, they synonymous with anxiety. At the heart of this human sea, calls for help can be swallowed by chaos, leaving individuals with a feeling of isolation and invisibility.

        <div class="muted text-lg font-medium w-3/4">
          To structure our design approach, we modeled the experience around six interconnected dimensions. The material and interactive dimensions form the technical core, combining a durable, light-based bracelet with an intuitive mobile interface for quick, stress-free use. The informative and declarative dimensions define how users receive and share information, creating a simple visual language that connects individuals through light signals. Finally, the social and psychological dimensions emerge as outcomes â€” fostering empathy, reassurance, and a lasting sense of safety within the crowd.

    <p class="muted mb-8">
      Following our initial ideation phase, we used our journey maps to create a storyboard depicting the concert experience, now enhanced with our proposed concept. By building on the key opportunities and interactions identified in the user journeys, the storyboard allowed us to visualize how the idea could improve the experience. This scenario featuring our two personas then served as the basis for our 5-second tests, assessing users' understanding, interest, and feedback on the concept.The goal was to explore participants' understanding of the device, its perceived personal and collective value, potential limitations, and possible improvements. Overall, participants grasped the concept and found it reassuring. Some concerns did arise, however: would the light remain visible amid the chaos of a concert? Would others respond to the signal? Could the system be misused?

      <h3 class="heading-3 mb-8">Aesthetic</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        The visual identity draws inspiration from pop-rock concert culture, combining deep purples and luminous tones.  Purple â€” a color of creativity and transition â€” evokes both artistic energy (from Monet to Hendrix) and calmness, often used in sensory environments to soothe neurodivergent audiences. LightCrowd's small luminous mascots personify this vision: anonymous, soft-edged shapes symbolizing mass collectivity, whose light reflects individual presence within the crowd â€” an echo of what the bracelet itself achieves.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-8">
      <h3 class="heading-3 mb-8">Accessibility</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        The red signal is reserved exclusively for emergencies to minimize cognitive load. Animated light motion supports color-blind users by reinforcing meaning through movement. Tactile feedback (two distinct vibrations: activation and confirmation) ensures usability under stress or in total darkness. The bracelet design enables operation with one hand, requiring no smartphone during critical moments. For users unable to raise their arms, proximity vibrations strengthen the sense of group connection, acting as a tactile compass paired with app-based geolocation.

          The LightCrowd bracelet is designed for intuitive use under stress. In emergencies, a long press triggers alert mode with a red animated light, signaling urgency and mimicking the crowd parting to clear a path. Before an event, the mobile app allows users to view the venue map, locate exits, and check crowd density, ensuring safe navigation. For post-event or non-urgent situations, the group mode helps users reconnect. Each group selects a unique color during setup. If someone is separated, activating this color flashes the other members' bracelets and provides haptic feedback as a tactile guide, making it easy to reunite with the group.

    <p class="muted mb-8">
      Our testing protocol aimed to evaluate how users could intuitively reconnect with friends in a crowded, noisy context â€” such as a concert. Rather than measuring success only through performance metrics, we focused on user experience quality and perceived immersion. To capture insights systematically, we used a Rainbow Sheet to document and visualize feedback across participants.

    <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-16 mb-12">
      <div>
        <p class="muted mb-4">This allowed us to:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside muted space-y-2">
          <li>Identify recurring usability issues and positive reactions.</li>
          <li>Categorize findings by severity and theme (affordance, clarity, feedback, immersion).</li>

        <p class="muted">
          We found three main biases in the first test: too much reading, an unrealistic environment, and abstract interactions. To correct them, we created a more authentic setup â€” dim lighting, concert sound and visuals, a mobile-based simulation with oral guidance, and contextual details like fake tickets and a bracelet rental to enhance immersion.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          â†’ To fix this, we moved to a more realistic setup: Dim lighting, music, and visual ambiance. Simulation on a mobile phone instead of a computer. Oral guidance instead of written text. Fake concert tickets and bracelet rental to create a narrative.

          The new setup made the experience far more natural. Participants stayed immersed, reacted intuitively, and provided richer, more emotional feedback. They could imagine using LightCrowd for real.

        <p class="muted">
          â†’ Findings: Removing sign-up steps improved engagement. The "Join your friends" button lacked affordance â€” we plan to use more intuitive icons (e.g. raised hand, group). Long-distance feedback needs reinforcement; a directional compass system will be tested next.
