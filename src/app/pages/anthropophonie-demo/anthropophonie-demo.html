        <p class="muted mb-4">
          On the UTC campus, human sounds such as conversations, footsteps, chairs scraping and doors slamming form a constant acoustic backdrop. At the university restaurant, noise levels often exceed 90 decibels, creating a stressful and exhausting atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p class="caption">
          What if noise was not just a nuisance, but a symptom of a deeper disconnection  from both nature and others? The problem was no longer the absence of natural sounds, but the impossibility of listening.

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-5">
      <p class="muted">
        We are pleased to present our project, conducted as part of the ICX1 course at UTC Compiègne. Launched in September 2024, this work explores the theme: "Students' relationship with nature in 2030." Over four months, our team developed reflections and innovative design directions around this topic.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The idea emerged from shared experiences within our team. For those from the countryside, the city's constant hum, especially at night when it never truly sleeps, felt overwhelming and restless. Conversely, for city dwellers, it was the rural silence and natural sounds: a rooster's crow, an owl's call that felt most disorienting, revealing just how foreign true quiet can be.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        This led to a fundamental question: "What does nature mean when we live in a world saturated with human sound?"
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Our ambition became clear: to use nature as a medium for collective well-being, not as decoration but as a trigger for sensory awareness.

        Our hypothesis was wrong  the issue wasn't bringing nature back, but restoring acoustic comfort and attention to the immediate environment. This marked a key learning: knowing when to let go of an appealing idea to stay aligned with user reality.

          <li>Aurore is highly sensitive to noise and seeks quiet, calming spaces</li>

            <p class="muted mt-4">
              To complement this qualitative insight, we conducted on-site observations and mapped the campus' soundscape, recording audio in various locations. The canteen consistently registered as the loudest area, with peaks exceeding 90 dBroughly equivalent to heavy urban trafficwhich aligned with students' experiences of noise-related discomfort.

    <!-- Our Solution -->

      <h3 class="heading-3">Our solution</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        Students highlighted that limited space makes zone separation difficult. The sound meter could induce guiltnot our goal. We want noise reduction to create calm, not stress. Following our research, we developed a two-zone solution for the university restaurant

      <p class="muted mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold text-accent uppercase">Ground Floor</span>: The ground floor features a living green wall composed of natural sound-absorbing plants. Integrated within this vegetation are mechanical flowers that react to sound levels:
      </p>
      <ul class="muted list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>When noise remains at acceptable levels, the flowers stay fully bloomed and open</li>
        <li>When sound exceeds the established threshold, the flowers close, returning to bud form</li>
      </ul>

        This creates a collective, non-intrusive feedback system that affects the entire space rather than singling out individuals.

      <p class="muted mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold text-accent uppercase">Upper Floor</span>: The first floor is reserved (without strict enforcement) for students seeking quieter conditions. Each table features a single flower protected under a glass dome, functioning as a localized sound meter. This allows each person or group to become aware of their acoustic impact. Students are gently encouraged either to reduce their volume or to return to the ground floor if they prefer a more social atmosphere.

        The prototype is a paper flower with a stem and petals. A ring slides along the stem, connected to the petals by paper strips. Pushing the ring down pulls the petals open; lifting it closes the flower. Though purple due to material availability, we envision a white peony symbolizing respect and affection. We brought our prototype to the university restaurant to gather feedback from users in situ.
